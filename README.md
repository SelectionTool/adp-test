# Adp-test
Adp is testing me

I created a custom utility class from scratch named “Request.js” located in “assets/js/utils/Request.js” to make executing request simple and cleaner.

Execute CLI: **npm run start**

Execute CLI test: **npm run test**

I converted all node modules to work on the browser using browserify

**browserify index.js -o index_browserify.js**

Execute server on localhost: **hosthttp-server**

**Check out your console for results**

Bye
